## 📖 Topics Covered

### 1. 🎒 Bag of Words (BoW)
- Simple word counting approach
- Vocabulary creation and document vectors
- Sparse representation concepts
- Limitations and use cases

### 2. 📊 TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Term frequency calculation
- Inverse document frequency weighting
- Step-by-step manual calculations
- Comparison with scikit-learn implementation

### 3. 🧠 Word2Vec
- Dense vector representations
- Semantic similarity and relationships
- Vector arithmetic (king - man + woman ≈ queen)
- Visualization of word embeddings

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
